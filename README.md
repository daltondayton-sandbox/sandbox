# üèñ Sandbox

A collection of miscellaneous code snippets, experiments, and learning materials that don't warrant their own repositories.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a playground for:
- Quick experiments and proof of concepts
- Learning new technologies
- Code snippets and examples
- Testing ideas before implementing them in actual projects

## Structure

Files and directories are organized by topic or technology. There's no strict structure - it's meant to be flexible and informal.

## Note

Code here may be incomplete, experimental, or work-in-progress. Use at your own risk!
